We have loan applications data for about 307k applications. The goal of this case is to perform Risk Analytics with the help of data wrangling and visualisation libraries of Python. The end goal is to derive important insights for the bank to identify the characteristics for bad loan applications. ( Bad loans are loans which are delayed/not paid.)
